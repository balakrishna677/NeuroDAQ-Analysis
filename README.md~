NeuroDAQ-Analysis
=================

Analysis enviroment for .HDF5 files, implemented in pure Python 2.7

Currently it allows fast browsing, plotting and analysis of 1-D data.
Numbers can be displayed in a table for exporting elsewhere.


Requirements:
-------------
. The GUI runs on PyQt4
. HDF5 data management is done by the h5py module
. Plotting is done by pyqtgraph. Get it here: http://www.pyqtgraph.org, and install with "python setup.py install"

This package has been tested in Ubuntu and Mac OS X.

For Mac OS X the easiest is to use the Anaconda distribution and just get pyqtgraph. XQuartz is also recommended, as plotting is faster than using Terminal.

For Linux get PyQt4 and h5py.
